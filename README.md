# TODO App

This project is a full-stack TODO application designed to enhance my skills across the complete technology stackâ€”from database design to server-side logic, and from API integration to a dynamic React frontend. Below is an outline of the tasks I completed and the technologies I employed.

## Project Overview

This TODO app serves as a practical exercise in applying full-stack development principles and practices. It involves setting up a database, building server-side APIs, and integrating them with a React frontend using React Query for efficient data fetching and state management.

## Completed Tasks

### Setup

- **Cloning and Installation**: Successfully cloned the repository, installed all necessary packages, and started the development server using `npm run dev`.

### Back End (Server-side)

1. **Database Design and Implementation**:
   - Designed a robust database schema to store task details, including fields for task description, priority level, and completion status.
   - Implemented database migrations and seeded initial data to facilitate testing and development.

2. **API Development**:
   - Developed a comprehensive API to interact with the database, supporting operations such as listing tasks, adding new tasks, updating existing tasks, and deleting tasks.
   - Conducted thorough testing of the API endpoints using Insomnia to ensure correct functionality and reliability.

### Front End (Client-side)

3. **React Component Development**:
   - Built a React component structure with static HTML to serve as the foundation of the app, adhering closely to the provided design templates for layout and styling.

4. **API Client Integration**:
   - Developed a client-side API integration layer to facilitate communication between the React frontend and the server-side API.

5. **Data Fetching and Mutation with React Query**:
   - Implemented data fetching functionality using the `useQuery` hook to retrieve task data efficiently from the API.
   - Utilized the `useMutation` hook to manage task creation, updates, and deletions, ensuring seamless data manipulation and UI updates.

### Stretch Goals

- Explored additional stretch challenges to further refine and enhance the application's features and performance.

### Deployment

- **Note**: For the WD04 Fullstack assessment, deployment to Dokku is required. This aspect is part of the ongoing development and deployment process.

## Feedback and Assessment

This project is submitted as part of the following Trello assessments:
- **WD03 - Forms**
- **WD04 - Fullstack**

Feedback on the repository and the project is welcomed to further improve and refine the application.
